# Inspiration

This project was inspired by my own need to stay on top of tasks and habits on a weekly basis. Most importantly, I did not want to rely on my phone for this as my phone gets flooded with random notifications throughout the day. I needed something solely for keeping track of my habits and tasks while being simple. After a quick search, I realized nothing quite matched what I had in mind sparking interest in building it myself as a personal project. 

This system was designed and programmed based on my personal workflow, goals, and priorities. If some of the behaviors or features of the project do not work for you, feel free to explore and modify the code. Make it your own!
