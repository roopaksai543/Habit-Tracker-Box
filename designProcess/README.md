# Design Process — Image Log

This folder documents the major milestones in my build. I didn’t capture every single version, but I photographed the biggest changes.

## 1) First Connection Test — Arduino ↔ LCD (jumper wires)
- **What’s shown:** Early breadboard stage while I was figuring out how to connect an Arduino to a 16×2 LCD with jumper wires.
- **Note:** The code used for this test is **not** included in the change log.

## 2) Version V4.2 — Dual LCDs (non-I²C) + 2 Pushbuttons + Arduino Nano
- **What’s shown:** V4.2 integrating **two LCDs without I²C**, two pushbuttons, and an Arduino Nano.
- **Focus:** Parallel wiring and panel layout exploration.

## 3) Final Box Interior — LCD + Arduino Uno + RTC (V6)
- **What’s shown:** The inside of the enclosure housing the LCD, **Arduino Uno**, and **DS3231 time module**. Highlights the wiring and internal organization.
- **Software:** Running **V6**, the latest code version.

## Notes
- Hardware evolved across multiple prototypes; only major jumps are shown here.
- Code versions are tracked in the main repo; images here are for hardware/assembly context.
